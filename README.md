# google-homepage

This project is an attempt to recreate the look and feel of Google homepage. 

I came up with this project at The Odin Project website, where I am taking a learning track to train myself web development. The link is below:

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css) 

My learning objectives for this project are to practice git, HTML, CSS and Chrome Developer Tools.
